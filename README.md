*** This is the full C# game project namely "Follow the path" ***

You can clone the Repo and import it on Unity 3D as it contains all the files needed.

Steps to follow:

1. Clone the Repository
2. Extract the Library.Zip file in the Source Folder.( the source folder has been compressed due to Committing issues )
3. Import on Unity 3D

You can play the short game by executing the "follow the path final game.Exe" file. You should place the
"follow the path" final game_Data folder and the .exe file together in a folder since the final game_Data folder
contains all the game data.
